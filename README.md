# Bulk-Organizer
**Organize files where filenames contain the date in yyyymmdd format**

I have a ton of call recordings in my phone which are uploaded to Google drive every 5 minutes.

Now, to make sure that they're all accessible when necessary, I needed to organize those files to.

The software which uploaded those files, didn't do much in terms of orgnizing them based on the date. 

So here's a small script to solve that problem.
### Before
![Messy Call Recordings](/images/callrecordings.jpeg)

### Filename format here

Call@xxxxxxxxxx(xxxxxxxxxx)_**20191018**122926 - 

* The bold part is the date. 
* The part right after that is the time in hhmmss format.
* The xxxxxxxxxx part is the caller's phone number.

### Commandline Output by the code
